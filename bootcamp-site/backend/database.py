    "ðŸ“¢ Hi everyone, hope you all had a restful weekend. The Accenture event overlaps with our normal bootcamp time, so we have a couple adjustments. Bootcamp will start promptly at 7:35pm at CSI 1121 (our usual room). If you want to network with the Accenture speakers, prioritize that and then come to bootcamp after. This will our last in-person lecture for the semester so please come if you can! We're gonna go until 8:35pm and we understand thatâ€™s a little late so youâ€™re free to leave around 8:15pm, but it would be great if you could stay the full time because we will be learning about SQL and database knowledge which will be important for your projects. See you Tuesday!!",
    "ðŸ“¢ reminder that we are having the Accenture event next Tuesday 6:30pm in Antonov auditorium. This is required for all of you! Please be prepared with a printed copy of your most updated resume",
    "ðŸ“¢ Hello bootcampers!! We are having our first App Dev Bootcamp Hackathon this semester! The prompt is: Imagine you are the Director of Education for App Dev Club. Build a web app that facilitates the bootcamp process. You have until December 3rd at 7:00pm to submit your project. You will be presenting with your team on December 3rd at 7:00pm in our usual bootcamp room CSI 1121. Detailed instructions for this hackathon can be found in the document link below. Happy coding!! https://docs.google.com/document/d/13GH77ppbY0O1szoMAVyKTgVk0ndZx6JioZaKiDTbGvk/edit?usp=sharing",
    "ðŸ“¢ I hope everyone is doing well! Next week, our team will have the opportunity to speak with the CMNS Board of Directors. Iâ€™d love for anyone in the app dev community to share how this club has impacted their life. If app dev has helped with anything. whether itâ€™s about career support (like helping you get an internship), community/social benefits, building your tech background, or anything else you want to shareâ€”please reach out to me via dms. We want to feature these quotes to showcase the true impact this club is making for students on campus. Hopefully showing real quotes can help us get more support so we can create more stories, similar to yours, in the future. Thank you, everyone!"
    "ðŸ“¢ we are considering doing App Dev Professional headshots in front of Iribe for everyone. It would be a good way for us to brand our LinkedIns similar to other clubs on campus, please like this is you are interested! Also please everyone try to put app dev in your LinkedIn if you are comfortable with it. Putting that you are involved helps people know who's in the community. Those who are on project teams, you can still put the sponsor company but please make clear that you are involved in App Dev using our company logo or in your activities or something :)"
    "ðŸ“¢ Join us for an exclusive evening with Accenture on September 18th from 6:30-7:30pm in Antonov Auditorium!
